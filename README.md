# ForkTheCaptcha

Welcome to ForkTheCaptcha! 🎉
<br>
This repository is a simple web project made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where a CAPTCHA is displayed to verify user interaction. Feel free to explore, contribute, and fork it for Hacktoberfest 2024! 🚀

<br>

# 🎯 Project Overview
CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a crucial feature used to prevent bots from abusing web forms and functionalities. This project is designed to demonstrate how to implement a basic CAPTCHA system using client-side technologies.

<br>

## 🌟 Features
- Dynamically generated CAPTCHA.
- Simple and clean UI.
- Designed for beginners to learn and contribute during Hacktoberfest 2024!

<br> 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML: Structure of the webpage.
- CSS: Styling and layout.
- JavaScript: CAPTCHA generation and validation logic.

<br>

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Fork this repository: Click the "Fork" button on the top right corner of this page and create your own copy of the repository.

2. Clone your fork:
```terminal
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ForkTheCaptcha.git
```

3. Navigate into the project directory:
```terminal
cd ForkTheCaptcha
```

4. Open the index.html file in your browser to see the CAPTCHA in action.

<br>

## 📝 How It Works
1. CAPTCHA Generation: The JavaScript function generates a random sequence of characters (alphanumeric) displayed as an image.

2. User Input: The user is prompted to enter the characters from the CAPTCHA image into a text field.

3. Validation: If the user input matches the CAPTCHA, the form is successfully submitted. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.
